# Emotion Recognition Using Face Detection ðŸŽ­ðŸ¤–

**A deep learning-based project for recognizing emotions through facial expressions in real-time! This project leverages OpenCV for face detection and a trained deep learning model for emotion classification. Perfect for exploring AI applications in human emotion analysis!**

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detect faces from a live webcam feed using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.
- **Emotion Prediction**: Recognize emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and more using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN).
- **Efficient Preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion, normalization, and resizing for optimal model input.
- **Interactive Output**: Display detected faces and their predicted emotions directly on the webcam feed.
