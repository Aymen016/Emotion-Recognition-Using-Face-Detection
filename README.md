# Emotion Recognition Using Face Detection üé≠ü§ñ

**A deep learning-based project for recognizing emotions through facial expressions in real-time! This project leverages OpenCV for face detection and a trained deep learning model for emotion classification. Perfect for exploring AI applications in human emotion analysis!**

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detect faces from a live webcam feed using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.
- **Emotion Prediction**: Recognize emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and more using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN).
- **Efficient Preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion, normalization, and resizing for optimal model input.
- **Interactive Output**: Display detected faces and their predicted emotions directly on the webcam feed.

## üíª Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emotion-Recognition-Using-Face-Detection.git
   cd Emotion-Recognition-Using-Face-Detection

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Download Haar Cascade File**:
   Ensure the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is in the project directory. If not, download it from the [OpenCV GitHub repository]  (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).

### üìä Model Overview  
The emotion recognition model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of facial expressions. It processes grayscale images resized to 48x48 pixels for efficient and accurate emotion classification.

**Predicted Emotions:**
- Happy üòä
- Sad üò¢
- Angry üò°
- Neutral üòê
- Surprise üò≤

#### Model Accuracy:
The model achieves an accuracy of **67%** on the FER-2013 test dataset. While this provides a solid foundation for recognizing emotions from facial expressions, there's room for improvement. We aim to fine-tune the model for better real-world performance.

---
### üéØ Future Enhancements
- **Add More Emotions**: Train the model to recognize additional emotions like Fear, Disgust, etc.
- **Improve Accuracy**: Fine-tune the model for better real-world performance.
- **Multi-Face Detection**: Extend the application to predict emotions for multiple faces simultaneously.
- **Web Integration**: Create a web-based interface for wider accessibility.
